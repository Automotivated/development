# Automotivated development
Automotivated development is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container setup for working on [Automotivated.vroom( )](https://github.com/Automotivated/vroom) or [Automotivated.engine( )](https://github.com/Automotivated/engine).

## Before we begin
Put on some nice [Electro Swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htbQgPh1DaA) and make sure you got the following applications installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

You can validate it by running `docker -v` in your favorite ([fish](https://fishshell.com/) || [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)) flavoured ([oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) || [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)) terminal ([iterm](https://www.iterm2.com/)).
It should output something like: `Docker version 17.03.0-ce, build 60ccb22`

First get the necessary dockerfiles by cloning this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Automotivated/development.git
```

From here we got two options:

1. Running the docker for active development on the projects
2. Improving the docker containers

## 1. Running the docker

## 2. Improving the environment
